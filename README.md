# billing-system

- Create products, add to factura, generate a pdf, has option to save and edit for later
- billing name address and owner need to be customizable

## Creating Database
  - access local host and phpmyadmin. Create a new database table based on missing file on project, and go to operations and add list. And import file from the folder **Database folder** and it should have the sql file.

## Workflow for future self:

You'll use Node.js with Express.js to build the server-side logic of your application. This includes handling routes, processing data, and communicating with the database.

For the frontend, you'll use either React or Angular to create the user interface. These frameworks help you manage UI components, handle user interactions, and update the display as data changes.

The backend and frontend communicate through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The backend exposes APIs that the frontend can use to request data and send data for processing.

Depending on your chosen database, you'll connect to it from the backend to store and retrieve data.

Both the backend and frontend codebase will be written in JavaScript, providing a consistent development experience.
